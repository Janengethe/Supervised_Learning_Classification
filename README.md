* Classification is a type of supervised machine learning task in which the goal is to assign objects or instances to predefined categories or classes. In supervised learning, the model learns from a dataset that contains input-output pairs, where the output (or target) is a discrete value representing the class label. Classification models can be used to predict the class of an object based on its input features.
